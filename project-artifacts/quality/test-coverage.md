# Test Coverage Metrics

This document outlines the test coverage metrics for the Lavagante project, providing insights into the extent to which the codebase is tested. Test coverage is a critical aspect of quality assurance, ensuring that the application behaves as expected and reducing the likelihood of defects.

## Coverage Summary

- **Overall Coverage**: XX%
- **Lines Covered**: XXX
- **Total Lines**: XXX
- **Branches Covered**: XX%
- **Functions Covered**: XX%

## Coverage by Module

| Module                      | Coverage (%) | Lines Covered | Total Lines |
|-----------------------------|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| src/dashboard               | XX%          | XXX           | XXX         |
| src/project-tracking        | XX%          | XXX           | XXX         |
| src/risk-management         | XX%          | XXX           | XXX         |
| src/communication           | XX%          | XXX           | XXX         |
| tests/unit                  | XX%          | XXX           | XXX         |
| tests/integration           | XX%          | XXX           | XXX         |

## Recommendations

- **Increase Unit Tests**: Focus on adding unit tests for critical functions that currently lack coverage.
- **Enhance Integration Tests**: Ensure that integration tests cover all major workflows and interactions between modules.
- **Regular Review**: Conduct regular reviews of test coverage reports to identify areas needing improvement.

## Tools Used

- **Coverage.py**: A tool for measuring code coverage of Python programs.
- **pytest**: A testing framework that makes building simple and scalable test cases easy.

## Conclusion

Maintaining high test coverage is essential for the success of the Lavagante project. Continuous monitoring and improvement of test coverage will help ensure the reliability and quality of the application as it evolves.
