# Code Quality Metrics

This document outlines the metrics used to assess the quality of the code within the Lavagante project. Maintaining high code quality is essential for ensuring the reliability, maintainability, and performance of the software.

## Key Code Quality Metrics

1. **Code Complexity**
   - **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Measures the number of linearly independent paths through the code. A lower value indicates simpler, more maintainable code.
   - **Halstead Complexity Measures**: Includes metrics such as the number of operators and operands, which help assess the difficulty of understanding the code.

2. **Code Coverage**
   - **Test Coverage Percentage**: The percentage of code that is executed during automated tests. Aim for at least 80% coverage to ensure critical paths are tested.
   - **Coverage by Module**: Breakdown of coverage metrics by individual modules or components to identify areas needing more tests.

3. **Code Duplication**
   - **Duplicated Lines of Code (LOC)**: The percentage of code that is duplicated across the codebase. High duplication can indicate poor design and should be minimized.

4. **Code Review Metrics**
   - **Review Turnaround Time**: The average time taken to review pull requests. Shorter times can indicate a more efficient review process.
   - **Review Comments per Pull Request**: The average number of comments made during code reviews. This can help gauge the thoroughness of reviews.

5. **Static Analysis Results**
   - **Linting Errors**: The number of linting errors detected by static analysis tools. Aim to resolve all critical and major issues before merging code.
   - **Security Vulnerabilities**: Number of identified security vulnerabilities in the codebase, tracked through tools like Snyk or Dependabot.

6. **Technical Debt**
   - **Technical Debt Ratio**: The ratio of the cost to fix issues in the codebase versus the cost to develop the code. A lower ratio indicates better code quality.

## Tools for Measuring Code Quality

- **SonarQube**: A platform for continuous inspection of code quality, providing detailed reports on various metrics.
- **Codecov**: A tool for measuring code coverage and providing insights into test effectiveness.
- **ESLint/Prettier**: Tools for maintaining code style and identifying potential issues in JavaScript codebases.
- **PyLint/Flake8**: Python tools for checking code quality and adherence to coding standards.

## Conclusion

Regularly monitoring these code quality metrics will help ensure that the Lavagante project maintains high standards of software quality, ultimately leading to a more robust and maintainable codebase.
