# Quality Metrics for Lavagante Project

This document outlines the quality metrics used to assess the performance and reliability of the Lavagante project. These metrics are essential for ensuring that the project meets its quality standards and delivers value to stakeholders.

## 1. Code Quality Metrics

- **Code Complexity**: Measures the complexity of the codebase using metrics such as Cyclomatic Complexity and Halstead Complexity.
- **Code Coverage**: Percentage of code covered by automated tests. Aim for a minimum of 80% coverage.
- **Code Smells**: Identification of potential issues in the code that may affect maintainability and readability.

## 2. Testing Metrics

- **Test Pass Rate**: Percentage of tests that pass during the testing phase. Aiming for a pass rate of 95% or higher is ideal.
- **Defect Density**: Number of confirmed defects divided by the size of the software entity (e.g., lines of code). This helps in assessing the quality of the code.
- **Test Execution Time**: Average time taken to execute the test suite. This metric helps in identifying performance bottlenecks in the testing process.

## 3. Performance Metrics

- **Response Time**: Average time taken for the application to respond to user requests. Target response time should be under 200 milliseconds.
- **Throughput**: Number of transactions processed by the application in a given time frame. This metric is crucial for understanding the application's capacity.
- **Resource Utilization**: Monitoring CPU and memory usage during peak loads to ensure the application runs efficiently.

## 4. User Satisfaction Metrics

- **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**: A measure of user satisfaction and loyalty. Regular surveys should be conducted to gauge user sentiment.
- **User Feedback**: Collection of qualitative feedback from users regarding their experience with the application.
- **Support Ticket Volume**: Number of support tickets raised by users. A decrease in ticket volume over time indicates improved user satisfaction.

## 5. Continuous Improvement

- **Retrospective Analysis**: Regularly review quality metrics during sprint retrospectives to identify areas for improvement.
- **Action Items Tracking**: Maintain a log of action items derived from quality metrics analysis and ensure they are addressed in future sprints.

By monitoring these quality metrics, the Lavagante project aims to maintain high standards of quality, ensuring that the final product is robust, reliable, and meets the needs of its users.
