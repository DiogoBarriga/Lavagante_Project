# Performance Indicators for Lavagante Project

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. **Velocity**
   - Definition: The amount of work completed in a sprint, measured in story points.
   - Target: Achieve a consistent velocity over three consecutive sprints.

2. **Burndown Rate**
   - Definition: The rate at which work is completed in a sprint.
   - Target: Maintain a steady burndown rate that aligns with the sprint goal.

3. **Cycle Time**
   - Definition: The total time taken from the start of work on a task until its completion.
   - Target: Reduce cycle time by 10% each quarter.

4. **Lead Time**
   - Definition: The time taken from the moment a new task is created until it is completed.
   - Target: Keep lead time under two weeks for new features.

5. **Defect Density**
   - Definition: The number of defects found in a software component divided by the size of the component (e.g., lines of code).
   - Target: Maintain a defect density of less than 1 defect per 1000 lines of code.

6. **Test Coverage**
   - Definition: The percentage of code covered by automated tests.
   - Target: Achieve at least 80% test coverage for all critical components.

7. **Stakeholder Satisfaction**
   - Definition: A measure of how satisfied stakeholders are with the project's progress and outcomes.
   - Target: Conduct quarterly surveys to achieve a satisfaction score of 4 out of 5 or higher.

## Tracking and Reporting

- **Frequency of Reporting**: KPIs will be reviewed and reported on a bi-weekly basis during sprint retrospectives.
- **Dashboard**: A metrics dashboard will be maintained to visualize these KPIs, providing real-time insights into project performance.
- **Action Plan**: If any KPI falls below the target, an action plan will be developed to address the issue in the next sprint.

## Conclusion

Regular monitoring of these performance indicators will help ensure that the Lavagante project remains on track and meets its objectives effectively.
