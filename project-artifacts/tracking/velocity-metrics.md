# Velocity Metrics

This document outlines the velocity metrics for the Lavagante project, providing insights into the team's performance and progress over time.

## Definition of Velocity

Velocity is a measure of the amount of work a team can complete in a given iteration (sprint). It is typically calculated by summing the story points of all completed user stories during the sprint.

## Tracking Velocity

To effectively track velocity, the following metrics should be recorded at the end of each sprint:

- **Sprint Number**: The identifier for the sprint.
- **Total Story Points Completed**: The sum of story points for all completed user stories.
- **Total Story Points Planned**: The sum of story points for all user stories planned for the sprint.
- **Velocity**: Calculated as the ratio of total story points completed to total story points planned.

## Velocity Metrics Table

| Sprint Number | Total Story Points Completed | Total Story Points Planned | Velocity |
|---------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|----------|
| Sprint 1      | 30                           | 40                         | 0.75     |
| Sprint 2      | 25                           | 35                         | 0.71     |
| Sprint 3      | 40                           | 40                         | 1.00     |
| Sprint 4      | 35                           | 50                         | 0.70     |

## Analysis

- **Trends**: Analyze the velocity trends over multiple sprints to identify patterns in team performance.
- **Adjustments**: Use velocity data to make informed decisions about future sprint planning and resource allocation.
- **Goals**: Set realistic goals for future sprints based on historical velocity data.

## Conclusion

Regularly tracking and analyzing velocity metrics is crucial for understanding team performance and improving project management practices within the Lavagante project.
