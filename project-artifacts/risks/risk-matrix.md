# Risk Matrix

The risk matrix is a tool used to assess and prioritize risks based on their likelihood of occurrence and potential impact on the project. It helps in visualizing the risk landscape and aids in decision-making for risk management strategies.

## Risk Matrix Structure

| Likelihood \ Impact | Low (1) | Medium (2) | High (3) | Critical (4) |
|----------------------|---------|------------|----------|---------------|
| **High (3)**         | Moderate Risk (3) | High Risk (6) | Critical Risk (9) | Critical Risk (12) |
| **Medium (2)**       | Low Risk (2)      | Moderate Risk (4) | High Risk (6) | High Risk (8) |
| **Low (1)**          | Low Risk (1)      | Low Risk (2)     | Moderate Risk (3) | Moderate Risk (4) |

## Risk Assessment Criteria

- **Likelihood**: The probability of the risk occurring.
  - Low (1): Rarely occurs
  - Medium (2): May occur occasionally
  - High (3): Likely to occur

- **Impact**: The potential effect on the project if the risk occurs.
  - Low (1): Minimal impact
  - Medium (2): Moderate impact
  - High (3): Significant impact
  - Critical (4): Catastrophic impact

## Risk Management Strategies

1. **Avoidance**: Change project plans to eliminate the risk.
2. **Mitigation**: Implement measures to reduce the likelihood or impact of the risk.
3. **Transfer**: Shift the risk to a third party (e.g., insurance).
4. **Acceptance**: Acknowledge the risk and prepare to manage its consequences.

## Conclusion

Regularly update the risk matrix to reflect new risks and changes in existing risks. This tool is essential for proactive risk management and ensuring project success.
