# Mitigation Plans for Identified Risks

This document outlines the strategies and actions to mitigate the risks identified in the Lavagante project. Each risk is assessed based on its potential impact and likelihood, and corresponding mitigation plans are provided.

## Risk Register Reference
Refer to the [Risk Register](../risk-register.md) for a comprehensive list of identified risks.

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Impact Level | Likelihood | Mitigation Plan |
|---------|------------------|--------------|------------|-----------------|
| R1      | Data loss due to system failure | High | Medium | Implement regular backups and a disaster recovery plan. Utilize cloud storage solutions for redundancy. |
| R2      | Delays in project timeline due to resource unavailability | Medium | High | Cross-train team members to ensure coverage. Maintain a buffer in the project schedule for critical tasks. |
| R3      | Inadequate stakeholder engagement | High | Medium | Schedule regular stakeholder meetings and updates. Use surveys to gather feedback and adjust plans accordingly. |
| R4      | Technical debt accumulation | Medium | High | Establish a code review process and allocate time in each sprint for refactoring and addressing technical debt. |
| R5      | Compliance issues with data handling | High | Low | Conduct regular audits and training sessions on compliance requirements. Implement automated compliance checks in the CI/CD pipeline. |
| R6      | Scope creep due to changing requirements | Medium | High | Define clear project scope and change management processes. Use Agile methodologies to manage and prioritize changes effectively. |

### Monitoring and Review
The mitigation plans will be reviewed and updated regularly during project retrospectives and sprint planning sessions. The effectiveness of each mitigation strategy will be monitored, and adjustments will be made as necessary to ensure project success. 

### Conclusion
By proactively addressing these risks with defined mitigation strategies, the Lavagante project aims to minimize potential disruptions and ensure a smooth project execution.
