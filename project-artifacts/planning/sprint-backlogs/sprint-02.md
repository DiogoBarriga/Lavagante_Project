# Sprint 02 Backlog

## Sprint Goal
The goal of Sprint 02 is to enhance the analytics engine by implementing additional features for data processing and improving the user interface for better interaction.

## Duration
- **Start Date:** [Insert Start Date]
- **End Date:** [Insert End Date]

## User Stories
1. **As a data analyst, I want to implement advanced statistical analysis features so that I can derive deeper insights from the data.**
   - Tasks:
     - Research statistical methods.
     - Implement z-score and moving average calculations.
     - Create unit tests for new features.

2. **As a product owner, I want to improve the user interface of the analytics dashboard so that users can easily navigate and access features.**
   - Tasks:
     - Design new UI mockups.
     - Implement UI changes based on feedback.
     - Conduct user testing sessions.

3. **As a developer, I want to optimize the data processing pipeline to reduce latency in data retrieval and analysis.**
   - Tasks:
     - Profile current data processing performance.
     - Identify bottlenecks and implement optimizations.
     - Document changes and performance improvements.

## Risks
- **Risk:** Potential delays in UI design feedback.
  - **Mitigation:** Schedule regular check-ins with stakeholders to gather feedback early.

- **Risk:** Performance optimizations may introduce new bugs.
  - **Mitigation:** Ensure comprehensive testing is conducted after optimizations.

## Review Criteria
- All user stories must be completed and accepted by the product owner.
- Code must pass all unit tests and meet quality gate standards.
- User feedback from testing sessions must be documented and addressed.

## Notes
- Ensure all tasks are updated in the project tracking tool.
- Regular stand-up meetings will be held to monitor progress and address any blockers.
