# Release Process for Lavagante Project

## Overview
The release process outlines the steps required to prepare, validate, and deploy new versions of the Lavagante project. This ensures that all changes are properly tested and documented before being made available to users.

## Release Planning
1. **Versioning**: Follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for all releases. Increment the version number based on the type of changes made:
   - Major version for incompatible API changes.
   - Minor version for adding functionality in a backward-compatible manner.
   - Patch version for backward-compatible bug fixes.

2. **Release Schedule**: Establish a regular release schedule (e.g., bi-weekly or monthly) to provide predictability for stakeholders.

## Pre-release Activities
1. **Feature Freeze**: Announce a feature freeze date prior to the release to allow time for testing and bug fixing.

2. **Testing**: Ensure all features and bug fixes are thoroughly tested:
   - Run unit tests and integration tests.
   - Perform manual testing on critical paths.
   - Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) with stakeholders.

3. **Documentation**: Update all relevant documentation, including:
   - User guides
   - API documentation
   - Release notes detailing new features, bug fixes, and known issues.

## Release Execution
1. **Build Process**: Trigger the CI/CD pipeline to build the project. Ensure that:
   - All tests pass.
   - Code quality gates are met.

2. **Tagging**: Tag the release in the version control system with the version number (e.g., `v1.0.0`).

3. **Deployment**: Deploy the release to the production environment using the automated deployment scripts.

## Post-release Activities
1. **Monitoring**: Monitor the application for any issues post-deployment. Utilize logging and monitoring tools to track performance and errors.

2. **Feedback Collection**: Gather feedback from users regarding the new release. This can be done through surveys, direct communication, or issue tracking.

3. **Retrospective**: Conduct a retrospective meeting to discuss what went well, what didnâ€™t, and how the release process can be improved for future releases.

## Conclusion
Following this release process will help ensure that the Lavagante project maintains high quality and reliability while delivering new features and improvements to users in a timely manner.
