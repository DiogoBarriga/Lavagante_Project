# Code Review Process

The code review process is a critical part of our development workflow, ensuring that all code changes are thoroughly examined before being merged into the main branch. This document outlines the steps and best practices for conducting effective code reviews within the Lavagante project.

## Objectives

- Ensure code quality and maintainability.
- Identify and fix bugs before they reach production.
- Share knowledge among team members.
- Foster collaboration and improve team communication.

## Code Review Workflow

1. **Pull Request Creation**
   - Developers should create a pull request (PR) for any changes they wish to merge into the main branch.
   - The PR should include a clear title and description, outlining the purpose of the changes and any relevant context.

2. **Assign Reviewers**
   - The author of the PR should assign at least two reviewers to ensure diverse feedback.
   - Reviewers should be selected based on their expertise related to the changes made.

3. **Review Process**
   - Reviewers should examine the code for:
     - Correctness: Ensure the code functions as intended.
     - Style: Adhere to the project's coding standards and conventions.
     - Performance: Identify any potential performance issues.
     - Security: Check for vulnerabilities and ensure secure coding practices.
     - Documentation: Verify that the code is well-documented and includes necessary comments.

4. **Feedback and Discussion**
   - Reviewers should provide constructive feedback, highlighting both strengths and areas for improvement.
   - Discussions should be respectful and focused on the code, not the individual.

5. **Addressing Feedback**
   - The author should address all feedback provided by the reviewers.
   - If changes are made, the author should update the PR and notify the reviewers.

6. **Approval and Merging**
   - Once all feedback has been addressed and the reviewers are satisfied, they can approve the PR.
   - The author or a designated team member can then merge the PR into the main branch.

7. **Post-Merge Actions**
   - After merging, the author should delete the branch associated with the PR to keep the repository clean.
   - A follow-up should be conducted to ensure that the changes are functioning as expected in the main branch.

## Best Practices

- **Keep PRs Small**: Smaller, focused PRs are easier to review and understand.
- **Use Descriptive Commit Messages**: Clear commit messages help reviewers understand the changes made.
- **Automate Where Possible**: Utilize automated tools for linting and testing to catch issues early.
- **Encourage Participation**: Foster an environment where all team members feel comfortable participating in code reviews.

## Conclusion

Implementing a structured code review process is essential for maintaining high-quality code and fostering a collaborative team environment. By following the steps outlined in this document, we can ensure that our codebase remains robust, secure, and maintainable.
