# Quality Assurance Process

## Overview
Quality Assurance (QA) is a critical aspect of the Lavagante project, ensuring that the product meets the required standards and fulfills the needs of stakeholders. This document outlines the QA processes, methodologies, and tools utilized throughout the project lifecycle.

## QA Objectives
- Ensure the delivery of high-quality software that meets user requirements.
- Identify and resolve defects early in the development process.
- Continuously improve processes and practices based on feedback and metrics.

## QA Processes

### 1. Test Planning
- Define the scope and objectives of testing.
- Identify resources, tools, and timelines for testing activities.
- Develop a test strategy that aligns with project goals.

### 2. Test Design
- Create detailed test cases based on requirements and acceptance criteria.
- Utilize techniques such as boundary value analysis and equivalence partitioning to design effective tests.
- Ensure traceability between requirements and test cases.

### 3. Test Execution
- Execute test cases in accordance with the test plan.
- Document test results, including pass/fail status and any defects identified.
- Perform regression testing to ensure that new changes do not adversely affect existing functionality.

### 4. Defect Management
- Log defects in a centralized tracking system.
- Prioritize defects based on severity and impact on the project.
- Collaborate with development teams to ensure timely resolution of defects.

### 5. Test Automation
- Identify repetitive and high-risk test cases suitable for automation.
- Implement automated testing frameworks and tools to enhance testing efficiency.
- Regularly maintain and update automated tests to reflect changes in the application.

### 6. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- Integrate automated tests into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure that code changes are validated continuously.
- Monitor build and test results to quickly identify and address issues.

### 7. Quality Metrics
- Define and track key quality metrics, such as defect density, test coverage, and test execution rates.
- Use metrics to assess the effectiveness of QA processes and identify areas for improvement.

### 8. Review and Retrospective
- Conduct regular reviews of QA processes and outcomes.
- Gather feedback from stakeholders and team members to refine QA practices.
- Document lessons learned and best practices for future projects.
