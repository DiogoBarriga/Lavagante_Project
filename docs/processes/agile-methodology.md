# Agile Methodology in the Lavagante Project

## Overview
The Agile methodology is a flexible and iterative approach to project management and software development. It emphasizes collaboration, customer feedback, and rapid delivery of functional software. The Lavagante project adopts Agile principles to enhance productivity and responsiveness to change.

## Agile Principles
1. **Customer Satisfaction**: Deliver valuable software early and continuously to satisfy the customer.
2. **Embrace Change**: Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
3. **Frequent Delivery**: Deliver working software frequently, with a preference for the shorter timescale.
4. **Collaboration**: Business stakeholders and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
5. **Motivated Individuals**: Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6. **Face-to-Face Conversation**: The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is through face-to-face conversation.
7. **Working Software**: The primary measure of progress is working software.
8. **Sustainable Development**: Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9. **Technical Excellence**: Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
10. **Simplicity**: The art of maximizing the amount of work not done is essential.

## Agile Practices in Lavagante
### Scrum Framework
- **Sprints**: The project is divided into time-boxed iterations called sprints, typically lasting 2-4 weeks.
- **Daily Standups**: Short daily meetings to discuss progress, plans, and obstacles.
- **Sprint Planning**: At the beginning of each sprint, the team plans the work to be completed.
- **Sprint Review**: At the end of each sprint, the team reviews the work done with stakeholders.
- **Sprint Retrospective**: The team reflects on the sprint to identify improvements for future sprints.

### Kanban Board
- A Kanban board is used to visualize work, limit work in progress, and maximize flow. Tasks are represented as cards on the board, moving through columns that represent different stages of the workflow.

### User Stories
- User stories are used to capture requirements from the end-user perspective, ensuring that the development team understands the value of the features being built.

### Continuous Improvement
- The team regularly reviews processes and practices to identify areas for improvement, fostering a culture of continuous learning and adaptation.

## Conclusion
The Agile methodology implemented in the Lavagante project promotes flexibility, collaboration, and a focus on delivering value to customers. By adhering to Agile principles and practices, the project aims to enhance productivity and responsiveness to changing requirements.
