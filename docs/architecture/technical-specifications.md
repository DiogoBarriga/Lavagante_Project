# Technical Specifications for Lavagante Project

## Overview

This document outlines the technical specifications for the Lavagante project, detailing the architecture, technology stack, and key components that will be utilized throughout the project lifecycle. The goal is to provide a clear understanding of the technical framework and design decisions that guide the development process.

## Architecture

The Lavagante project follows a modular architecture that separates concerns into distinct components. This approach enhances maintainability, scalability, and testability. The main components include:

- **Dashboard**: Responsible for collecting, visualizing, and reporting project metrics.
- **Project Tracking**: Manages tasks, sprints, and time tracking for Agile development.
- **Risk Management**: Identifies, analyzes, and mitigates risks associated with the project.
- **Communication**: Facilitates notifications and updates to stakeholders.

### System Architecture Diagram

Refer to the system architecture diagram located in `docs/architecture/diagrams/system-architecture.md` for a visual representation of the components and their interactions.

## Technology Stack

The following technologies and frameworks are utilized in the Lavagante project:

- **Programming Languages**: Python for backend development, JavaScript for frontend components.
- **Frameworks**: Flask for web services, Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data storage.
- **Version Control**: Git for source code management, with GitHub for collaboration and issue tracking.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment workflows.

## Key Components

### Metrics Dashboard

The metrics dashboard is designed to provide real-time insights into project performance. Key features include:

- **Metrics Collection**: Automated scripts to gather data on project progress, team velocity, and quality metrics.
- **Reporting**: Generation of reports for stakeholders, including daily standups and sprint summaries.

### Project Tracking

The project tracking component includes:

- **Task Management**: Tools for creating, assigning, and tracking tasks within sprints.
- **Burndown Charts**: Visual representations of work completed versus work remaining.

### Risk Management

Risk management processes involve:

- **Risk Identification**: Regular assessments to identify potential risks.
- **Mitigation Planning**: Strategies to minimize the impact of identified risks.

### Communication

Effective communication with stakeholders is facilitated through:

- **Notification System**: Automated alerts for project updates and important milestones.
- **Stakeholder Reports**: Regular updates on project status, including weekly and milestone reports.

## Agile/Scrum Implementation

The Lavagante project adopts Agile methodologies, specifically Scrum, to enhance flexibility and responsiveness to change. Key practices include:

- **Sprints**: Time-boxed iterations for delivering increments of the project.
- **Daily Standups**: Short meetings to discuss progress and obstacles.
- **Retrospectives**: Meetings at the end of each sprint to reflect on what went well and what can be improved.

## Quality Gates

Quality gates are implemented to ensure that code meets specified standards before merging. This includes:

- **Code Reviews**: Peer reviews of code changes to maintain quality and consistency.
- **Automated Testing**: Integration of unit and integration tests to validate functionality.

## Stakeholder Reporting

Regular reporting to stakeholders is crucial for transparency and accountability. Reports include:

- **Weekly Status Updates**: Summaries of progress, challenges, and next steps.
- **Milestone Reports**: Detailed reports on the achievement of project milestones.

## Conclusion

This technical specification document serves as a foundational reference for the Lavagante project, guiding the development team in implementing the architecture and technology stack effectively. Regular updates to this document will be made as the project evolves and new decisions are made.
