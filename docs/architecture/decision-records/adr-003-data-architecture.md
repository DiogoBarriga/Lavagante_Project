# Decision Record: Data Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The data architecture for the Lavagante project is critical for ensuring efficient data processing, storage, and retrieval. As the project evolves, it is essential to define a clear data architecture that supports scalability, performance, and maintainability.

## Decision
The following key decisions have been made regarding the data architecture:

1. **Data Storage**: 
   - We will use a combination of relational databases (PostgreSQL) for structured data and NoSQL databases (MongoDB) for unstructured data. This hybrid approach allows us to leverage the strengths of both database types.

2. **Data Modeling**:
   - The data will be modeled using an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram for the relational database, ensuring normalization to reduce redundancy. For NoSQL, we will use a document-based model that allows for flexibility in data structure.

3. **Data Access Layer**:
   - A Data Access Object (DAO) pattern will be implemented to abstract the database interactions. This will provide a clean API for the application to interact with the data layer, promoting separation of concerns.

4. **Data Processing**:
   - We will utilize Apache Kafka for real-time data streaming and processing. This will enable us to handle high-throughput data ingestion and processing, ensuring that the system can scale with increasing data loads.

5. **Data Security**:
   - Data encryption will be enforced both at rest and in transit. We will use industry-standard encryption protocols (AES-256 for data at rest and TLS for data in transit) to protect sensitive information.

6. **Backup and Recovery**:
   - Regular backups will be scheduled for both the relational and NoSQL databases. We will implement a disaster recovery plan that includes point-in-time recovery options to minimize data loss.

## Consequences
- The hybrid data storage approach will provide flexibility and scalability but may introduce complexity in data management.
- The DAO pattern will enhance maintainability but may require additional development effort.
- Using Apache Kafka will improve data processing capabilities but necessitates expertise in stream processing technologies.
- Implementing strong security measures will protect sensitive data but may add overhead in terms of performance and complexity.

## Next Steps
- Develop the ER diagram and document-based model for the databases.
- Set up the initial database schemas and configure the data access layer.
- Implement the data processing pipeline using Apache Kafka.
- Establish security protocols and backup strategies.
