# Decision Record: Technology Stack

## ADR-002: Technology Stack

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

### Context

The technology stack chosen for the Lavagante project is critical for ensuring that the project meets its performance, scalability, and maintainability goals. The selection of technologies impacts development speed, team productivity, and the overall success of the project.

### Decision

The following technology stack has been selected for the Lavagante project:

1. **Programming Languages:**
   - **Python**: Chosen for backend development due to its simplicity, readability, and extensive libraries for data analysis and machine learning.
   - **JavaScript**: Used for frontend development to create interactive user interfaces.

2. **Frameworks:**
   - **Flask**: A lightweight web framework for building the backend API.
   - **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, chosen for its component-based architecture and performance.

3. **Database:**
   - **PostgreSQL**: Selected as the relational database management system for its robustness, scalability, and support for advanced data types.

4. **Data Processing:**
   - **Pandas**: Utilized for data manipulation and analysis.
   - **NumPy**: Used for numerical computations.

5. **Deployment:**
   - **Docker**: Chosen for containerization to ensure consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
   - **GitHub Actions**: Implemented for CI/CD to automate testing and deployment processes.

6. **Project Management:**
   - **Jira**: Selected for tracking issues, managing sprints, and facilitating Agile methodologies.
   - **GitHub Projects**: Used for Kanban-style project management and tracking progress.

### Consequences

- The chosen stack allows for rapid development and iteration, leveraging the strengths of each technology.
- The use of Docker ensures that the application can be easily deployed and scaled in various environments.
- The integration of GitHub Actions for CI/CD will streamline the development workflow and improve code quality through automated testing.

### Alternatives Considered

- **Django** was considered as an alternative to Flask but was ultimately not chosen due to its larger footprint and complexity for the current project scope.
- **MySQL** was also evaluated as a database option but PostgreSQL was preferred for its advanced features and performance.

### Next Steps

- Document the implementation details of each technology in the project's technical specifications.
- Set up the initial project structure using the selected technologies.
- Begin development of the core features using the chosen stack.
