# System Architecture

The system architecture of the Lavagante project is designed to support a modular and scalable approach to project management and analytics. This document outlines the key components of the architecture, their interactions, and the technologies used.

## Overview

The Lavagante project architecture consists of several layers, including:

1. **Presentation Layer**: This layer is responsible for user interaction and visualization of data. It includes dashboards and reporting tools that provide insights into project metrics and performance.

2. **Application Layer**: This layer contains the core business logic and processes. It includes modules for project tracking, risk management, and communication with stakeholders.

3. **Data Layer**: This layer manages data storage and retrieval. It includes databases and data processing components that handle project-related data, metrics, and reports.

4. **Integration Layer**: This layer facilitates communication between different components of the system and external services. It includes APIs and integration points for third-party tools.

## Components

- **Dashboard**: A web-based interface that visualizes project metrics, performance indicators, and reports.
- **Project Tracking**: Modules that manage tasks, sprints, and time tracking for Agile development.
- **Risk Management**: Tools for identifying, analyzing, and mitigating risks associated with the project.
- **Communication**: Systems for notifying stakeholders and automating report generation.
- **Kanban Board**: A visual management tool for tracking project progress and managing tasks.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for backend development.
- **Flask/Django**: Frameworks used for building the web application and APIs.
- **PostgreSQL/MySQL**: Relational databases for storing project data.
- **Docker**: Containerization technology for deploying the application.
- **GitHub Actions**: For CI/CD, metrics collection, and automated reporting.
